# **Car Location App**

##### **Please note in order to ue this App you need an Android phone that has a sim card with credit to allow it to send a text. The phone also needs to have Location sensor turned on. You also need to have another Phone that is able to text the Android phone you have the app installed on.** <br /> <br />

## *To set up this project on your own Android Phone, along with testing it and altering it you need to follow the below instructions;* <br /><br />

## *Upload the Project to MIT App Inventor;*

1. Download the Project.aia file found in the code section on github. You can dowload it as a zip by clicking on code, then download zip.

## *Changing the Phone Numbers to your Desired Number/Numbers;*

1. When in the Project that was just uploaded click on "Blocks" on the top right of the screen. You will then see all the blocks that make the App function. 

2. There are currently 5 Sentences / Phrases set up here, to add a number for that phrase click on the pink box that is next to "Set TextMe.PhoneNumber to" then enter in your number in the following format "+3538512345678". Do this for all the Sentences / Phrases you want to use.
At the Bottom you will see message that is sent back if the phrase is wrong, set this number the same way to your main mobile device as it will be used to test and ensure the app is working if the wrong phrase is sent. <br /> <br />

## *Deleting / Changing the sentences/Pharses*
